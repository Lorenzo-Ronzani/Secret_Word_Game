# Secret Word

Secret Word is a simple word guessing game built with React.
This project was created to practice core React concepts such as component-based structure, state management, and basic game logic.

## How it works

* The player guesses the word letter by letter
* Each incorrect guess reduces the number of attempts
* The game ends when the word is guessed or when the attempts run out
